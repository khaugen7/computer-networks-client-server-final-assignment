This is the final assignment for CS3357 - Computer Networks I for which I received a full 100% grade.

The purpose of the assignment was to create a file-transfer server, along with the client for downloading files and
a load balancer to share traffic amongst various server instances. We built each component as separate assignments
throughout the year and the final assignment consisted of adding the load balancer and multiple server instances.

The README in the assignment subdirectory has information on running and interacting with the program.
